# Food Saver

Food Saver is an application that keeps track of your perishable food at home to help reduce food waste and guide sustainable grocery shopping. If any food item is closely approaching its expiration date, Food Saver will send notifications as a reminder to make use of that food soon. Food Saver also gives recipe recommendations to help you make the best use of your food.

## Getting Started

To run this project, run ```$ npm install``` in both ```foodsaver-frontend``` and ```foodsaver-backend``` folders to get all dependencies and packages.

#### Knex.js & MySQL

When running Knex.js migrations, please run the ```users``` migration file first in order to avoid any DB issues. Afterwards, please ensure to run the remaining migration files (```inventory```, ```notifications```, ```favorites```). 

#### .env

```.env.sample``` in ```foodsaver-backend``` provides a sample of environment variables required to run this project. You will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file:

For Local Database: 
`PORT`
`DB_HOST`
`DB_DBNAME`
`DB_USER`
`DB_PASSWORD`
